# react-hello-world
React application to practice the usage of Props and States.
## Major Takeaways:
1. "States" are private and can be changed from within a component.
2. "Props" are external, and not controlled by a component itself. They are passed down from components higher up the hierarchy, who also control the data.
3. A component can change its internal states directly. It cannot change its props directly.
